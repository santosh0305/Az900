Az Geography 
 Az Region 
  Az-1 
  Az-2 
  Az-3 

e.g Az Geography (Asia Pacific) 
     South India (Chennai) 
     West India (Mumbai) 
     Central India (Pune) 
      Az-1 
      Az-2 
      Az-3 
     Jio India Central (Nagpur) 
     Jio India West (Jamnagar) 

Az Regions 
Geographic locations 
Location based data center 
Each Azure region features datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter 
They're connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network 

Availability Zones
Region with multiple data centers 
1 or more datacenters = availability zone 
has independent cooling + security + electricity 

Az Portal  
B1S - free tier VM  

Resource (R) 
manageable item on Az 
app service (web-app), Vm, Az Sql 
VM -> assigned to NSG (Network Security Group - control traffic to VM) 
Disk attached to Vm 

Resource Groups (RG) 
Container to hold resources (R) (Collection of Resources) 
group set of resources 
collectively manage all resources 
(xxxxx-rg) naming convention (-rg-prod, -rg-dev, -rg-qa, -rg-uat) 
all resources are mapped with RG 

Az Virtual Network 
Define own network in Az 
VMs created are hosted in VN 
Can create Multiple VNs 
VNs consists multiple SUBNETS 
Need to assign IPv4 Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16 
Define multiple subnets 
Each subnet - subset of VN 
 subnet1 - 10.0.1.0/24 
 subnet2 - 10.0.2.0/24 
VMs are created part of subnet (range of IP addresses in the virtual network) 
VMs will get private address (depends on subnet) 
 10.0.1.4 , 	10.0.2.4 
Communication through private address 
We can assign Public IP to VM 
 40.11.112.4 | 50.1.200.4 

Communicate VMs through VNs: 
Direct VM to VM comm not possible 
VN Peering connection 

Az Virtual Machines (IAAS)
No manage infra, Az will manage 
Deploy any type of workload (see types of VMs) 
Assigned Disks for storage (VHD files) 
Assigned OS disk (SSD) 
VM is placed inside VN(Subnet) 
Assigned Network Interface (NI) separate resource 
NI enables a virtual machine to communicate with Internet, Azure, and on-premises resources 
NI gets private and public IP 
Can add Data disk 

NSG - controls traffic flow to VM 

Monitoring: CPU and N/W utilization 

Az Dedicated Hosts (VM) 
Physical server as Resource 
Host VMs 
Complete H/W isolation, no others can host their VMs 
Control over Az's schedule-maintained events 

Az Market Place 
In general, you have to create VM, install WordPress / oracle db. 
In marketplace, you can get VM which has got WordPress / oracle db installed. 

Network Security Group (NSG) 
Control traffic into subnet / vm 
contains rules for I/O traffic 
like a Virtual Network Interface Card 
when you create VM, it's not directly accessible outside i.e., RDP 
Allow RDP traffic via NSG 
Allow Http traffic via NSG 

Scale sets VM (High Availability) 
Scale infra based on demand 
Scale Out -> Demand Increases, increase VM count (Come Out / expand) 
Scale In -> Demand Decreases, decrease VM count (sink in) 
Applied to VMs + Web Apps 
In general, if we stop VM to increase size, this causes down time to customers 
Scale OUT: Starts increasing VMs when certain condition is met i.e., CPU utilization > 70%	(Adds Vms from scale sets) 
Scale IN: Starts decreasing VMs when certain condition is met i.e., CPU utilization < 30% 	(Remove Vms from scale sets) 
Instance Count: 1 Vm in beginning 

Az Load Balancer  
High Availability for web-apps 
Allows to distribute traffic to backend VMs in VN 
It directs requests to backend VMs 
Global LB - balance traffic at geographies level
Internal LB - balance traffic with-in VN 
Public LB - balance traffic coming from internet 
2 Pricing Tiers - Basic & Standard 
In Az Portal, select Type: Internal / External (this is where you define whether you are creating internal / external load balancer) 
Case: (ILB, ELB) 
  2 Db servers + 2 App Servers 
  2 App Servers exposed to Users via Internet 
ILB - balance traffic b/w 2 DB servers and 2 App Servers 
ELB - balance traffic b/w 2 App Servers and Users 
Lab: Steps for Creating LB 
     Frontend IP Config  
     Backend Pool - VMs (In Load Balancer creation, select VMs i.e., linking VMs with Load Balancer) 
     Health Probe - check health of VMs 
     Load balancing Rules - forward request (User -> LB -> Front IP -> Backend pool VM) 
Works at layer 4 i.e., at Network Layer 

Application Gateway (AG) 
It’s a type of LB that works at Layer -7 i.e., at Application Layer 
Full managed services (no need to manage, infra, scalability, availability) 
URL Based routing (Routing based on routes) 
User -> AG -> VM 
case where 2 routes are available: http:<domain>/ & http:<domain>/video & http:<domain>/images 
Depending on the route i.e., path of the URL, AG will redirect that request to relevant VM 
here, VM to process videos (http:<domain>/video) 
here, VM to process images (http:<domain>/images) 

Add Web Application Firewall as feature (Protect Web Apps in VM to avoid SQL Injection, Cross Site scripting)	 

Big Word Alert: VM,VN,Subnet,NI,NSG,R,RG, 

Storage Accounts (Highly Scalable) 
Types: Blob, File, Table, Queue 
No manage infra. durable, available and scalable on demand 
Lab : 
Create Storage Account + Containers (upload objects to containers) 
Hot Tier	-Data accessed frequently 
Cool Tier	-Data accessed infrequently 
Archive Tier	-Data accessed rarely (you cannot get data if it's in this mode, will have to change its tier to Cool/Hot to get data out of archive 
Set restrains while accessing in BLOB storage 

Blob Storage- 
Object store 
Store unstructured data 
Case for storing files, videos, images / backup data 
Store log files 

Table Storage 
Store structed NoSQL data 
Key attribute store 
Cost effective option 

File Storage

usecase : Decouple components of app 
Single message can have 64kb in size 
Store millions of messages in queue 

Region Pairs (Replicate data in other Regions - Availability) 
Region contains data centers (low latency) 
Az geography is an area containing 1 Az region 
Can't decide region pair, Az handles it dynamically (In US-East, you created storage, and enabled Redundancy 
LRS 		– Locally redundant storage 
ZRS 		– Zone redundant storage 
GRS		- Geo redundant storage 
RA-GRS		- Read-Access geo-redundant storage 
GZRS		- geo-zone-redundant storage

Point to Site 	– connect workstations to Az Vnet 
- Install VPN client 
- use Certificates to auth clients 
Site to Site	- Connect on-premise VNet to Az VNet   

Virtual Network Peering (VM Specific) 
2 VMs in 2 VNets 
Communication has to be through Public IP, to enable communication through Private IP address over Azure backbone network 
Security benefit as traffic doesn't flow through Internet

Az SQL Database (PAAS) 
No manage, managed by Az 

Differences of SQL on PASS Vs SQL IAAS 
SQL–PAAS	- 99.99 % availability, built-in backup and recovery, minimal set of features are not 		   available, reduces Infra and maintenance cost 
VM–SQL–IAAS	- Full control over SQL server engine, easy to migrate on-premise instance, maintained 		   by us, hence handle patch upgrades of system, handle manage availability manually 

Managed Instance – if lift and shift existing on-premise database to Azure 
Pricing is done in DTU (Database Transaction Unit) bundles measure of compute, storage and IO resources 
vCore based model allows customers to choose amount of compute and storage, allows to control underlying resources and gives more flexibility. 
Is ideal if have licenses.
Can use SSMS, VS IDE, .NET programs to connect and query DB. 

DTU – Database transaction Unit, it’s a measure of represents a blended measure of CPU, memory, reads, and writes. 
Higher DTUs means higher Costing. DTUs are for SQL Database. 
SQL server & SQL database are created when we create SQL Database in Az 
In SQL Server, set Firewalls and VPN as to enable access to DB from external clients. 
Can also configure AD. Remember Server Name and Server Admin

Cloud Design Patterns 

Kubernetes & Docker Architecture 

Microservices 

Scaling in database 

ARM templates: what is the structure of JSON, what's inside it 

Use case of search: which DB will you use 

URL Shortener – how will you design 

Elastic search – searching to be faster 

Vertical Vs Horizontal scaling – In Vertical, there is only one instance, hence risk of failure if something goes wrong.
